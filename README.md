This is a video player for Android tablets that allows to conduct "Napping" experiments. What are napping experiments?

From Nestrud, Michael A., and Harry T. Lawless. "Recovery of subsampled dimensions and configurations derived from napping data by MFA and MDS." Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics 73.4 (2011): 1266-1278:

> Projective mapping is a relatively new psychological measurement method that was introduced in the mid-1990s […]. It has also been coined “napping” (Pagès, 2005), owing to the French term for tablecloth. The method involves having participants evaluate and physically place stimuli (usually food items) on a large sheet of paper (approximately 60 cm × 60 cm). Stimuli that are similar are placed close together, and stimuli that are dissimilar are placed farther apart. The data collected are the X,Y coordinates of the items with the origin typically being the bottom left of the paper, although it is arbitrary. The X and Y coordinates represent attributes, so we have information on two attributes for each stimulus.
