This is a video player for Android tablets that allows to conduct "Napping" experiments. What are napping experiments?

From Nestrud, Michael A., and Harry T. Lawless. "Recovery of subsampled dimensions and configurations derived from napping data by MFA and MDS." Attention, Perception, & Psychophysics 73.4 (2011): 1266-1278:

> Projective mapping is a relatively new psychological measurement method that was introduced in the mid-1990s […]. It has also been coined “napping” (Pagès, 2005), owing to the French term for tablecloth. The method involves having participants evaluate and physically place stimuli (usually food items) on a large sheet of paper (approximately 60 cm × 60 cm). Stimuli that are similar are placed close together, and stimuli that are dissimilar are placed farther apart. The data collected are the X,Y coordinates of the items with the origin typically being the bottom left of the paper, although it is arbitrary. The X and Y coordinates represent attributes, so we have information on two attributes for each stimulus.

## Installation and usage

Please refer to [the NappingPlayer Wiki](https://github.com/slhck/napping-player/wiki) for complete instructions on installing, configuring and using the player.
The Wiki also contains extensive information on data analysis.


## Features

- Tablet-ready landscape view of the "nap"
- Sequential playing of video material loaded on the device
- Drag video buttons around after seeing them
- Repeat a video any time
- Export coordinates of video buttons
- Export screenshot of the nap
- Group videos and export groups
- Send result e-mail after experiment
- Inspect experiment data on the device itself
- Fully internationalized for English and German (more to come)

## System requirements

- Android tablet with at least 7" screen size or a resolution of about 1200x700 pixels.
- Android 3.0 or later. This app is tested with version 3.x and 4.x.
- Space on the SD card for video material
- A running internet connection if you want to send result files

## Development and issues

This app is under development. Things might break. Some stuff might be hard coded.

- If you find any issues or have suggestions for features, please post them on the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/slhck/napping-player/issues). Please mention your Android version and hardware, as well as specific steps to reproduce a bug.
